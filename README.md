# React NASA APOD App

A simple React app that connects to NASA's APOD endpoint to display today's picture/video or a random picture/video.

A random picture will be displayed if you click the shuffle ðŸ”€ button

There is a loading screen while content is being loaded, and an error message
with a retry button when an error is encountered.
